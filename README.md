## About:
This website is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. Tech Connect was mainly built to help users connect with others within the technology industry. Users can ask for help, share their work and connect with others along with many other features.

Demo

## Notes:
`Tech Connect` is my first *full-stack web application* created by using mainly `Node.js`, `Express`, `MySQL` and other helper dependencies as well. Creating sessions were pretty challenging at the begenning, I came across many bugs while creating the structure but, once I was able to find the issues and fix them one by one, creating the rest of the application was very enjoyable. I first thought of using a `CSS framework` like either `Bootstrap` or `Materilize` however, I wanted to do it with plain `CSS` so I could've have more control on it. I also used `bcrypt` for the first time to hash user passwords.

## Usage:
You must create an account to enter the application.
- Create an account.
- Login using your account information.
- On the `Home` page, you will see posts from other users and also your own (if any).
- To create a post click on the `Create Post` button navigated in the `Home` page.
- To see your posts, go to the `Dashboard` located in the navigation.
- To edit a post click on the title of the post, it will navigate to a page where editing and deleting is available.
- You could also add comments to posts by clicking on the `comments` bar under each post.
- Your session will automatically log-out if idle for 10 minutes.
- To manually log-out, simply click on the `Log-out` button on the navigation.

## Improvements & Issues:
This application mainly runs very smoothly & it is fully responsive however, it really isn't the best. One of the main issues for now is that users cannot delete their own posts if they commented on them and deleting comments is not a thing but, these could easily be fixed eventually. There could've been a lot more features added to it to actually make it usable in a daily routine. Some of the exciting features could be; leaving a like for posts, having your own profile, adding other users to your list and even a chat system to allow users to communicate with each other! All these are not impossible to add to it but, I will leave it as it is for now. This was a great exercise and I'm looking forward to build actual website that could support more...
